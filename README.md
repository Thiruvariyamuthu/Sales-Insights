## Project Impact

**Situation**: A computer hardware business was struggling to scale due to a rapidly changing market and a lack of actionable insights.

**Task**: I was tasked with performing data analysis using SQL and Power BI to track revenue growth, identify year-over-year (YoY) trends, and analyze region-wise sales performance.

**Action**: I built SQL queries to extract and clean the necessary data, followed by developing interactive Power BI dashboards. These visualizations highlighted key metrics such as revenue by region, top-performing products, and customer insights.

**Result**: The dashboard facilitated quick, data-driven decision-making by the companyâ€™s leadership, revealing sales trends and identifying areas for potential growth. As a result, it is projected to raise revenue by at least 7% in the next quarter.

## Data Cleaning

Data cleaning was performed using Power Query to ensure data accuracy before analysis:
- Removed duplicates
- Handled missing values
- Transformed data types
